Description:

Firstly I made the basic outline of the game. I wanted the cars to scroll downwards from the top of the screen
and the player car to move left or right at the bottom. The oncoming car positions were randomly generated.
Then I made the backgroud scroll infinitely to give a sense of movement. Then I designed a main menu with play, quit
buttons. I then used the SDL timer as the method for calculating the score. I displayed the score on the screen during 
game time and the final score in the gameover screen. I added replay, return and quit buttons on the gameover screen.
Then I made a settings option which has a "change difficulty" option which made the cars and background 
move faster and also a "select background" option to give a sense of customizability. Then I added an info button which
gives instructions regarding how to play the game. I added a "enter name" bar at gameover to give further customizability
and a top five feature which the top five highscores along with player names at the corresponding difficulty.
Then I added a jump functionality which allows the players car to jump over the oncoming car and avoid a collision.
This required me to make multiple images and display them in sequence to create a small animation. I then applied a time limit 
on the jump feature so that the player can only jump after a limited time.
